# The Art and Science of Prompt Design in Generative AI

---

## Introduction to Prompt Design

- **Prompt design** is a fundamental skill for effectively using generative AI.
- It involves crafting the input (prompt) you give to the model to elicit the best possible response.

---

## Getting Started with Prompts

- In Vertex AI Studio, click on **New prompt** to begin experimenting.
- **Free-form prompt:** Simply provide an instruction, e.g.,  
  *"Generate a list of items I need for a camping trip to Joshua Tree National Park."*

## Prompting Methods

There are three main methods to shape a model’s response:

### 1. Zero-shot Prompting
- **Definition:** Give the model a prompt that describes the task, without any examples.
- **Example:**  
  *"What is prompt design?"*

### 2. One-shot Prompting
- **Definition:** Provide a single example of the task you want the model to perform.
- **Example:**  
  *Prompt: Write a poem. Example: "Roses are red, violets are blue..."*

### 3. Few-shot Prompting
- **Definition:** Give a few examples to demonstrate the desired task and response format.
- **Example:**  
  - **Context:** IT help desk Q&A
  - **Examples:**  
    - "Couldn't log in" → Suggest a password reset  
    - "Lost internet connection" → Suggest checking the modem/router

## Structured Prompts

- **Context:** Instructions or background information to guide the model’s behavior.
- **Examples:** Input-output pairs to show the desired response style.
- **Input:** The new question or task you want the model to answer.

**Example:**  
- **Context:** Information about Amazon rainforest vegetation changes.
- **Examples:**  
  - Q: "What does LGM stand for?"  
    A: "Last Glacial Maximum"
  - Q: "What did the analysis from the sediment deposits indicate?"  
    A: "[Relevant answer]"
- **Input:** A new question for the model.

## Best Practices for Prompt Design

- Be concise.
- Be specific and clearly define the task.
- Ask for one task at a time.
- Include examples to improve response quality.
- Experiment with different structures and formats to find what works best.

## Saving and Reusing Prompts

- Save effective prompts for future use.
- Access saved prompts in the **prompt gallery**, a curated collection of sample prompts for various use cases.

## Model Parameters for Response Quality

You can experiment with several parameters to influence the model’s output:

| Parameter    | Description                                                                                     |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Model**    | Choose from different models, each tuned for specific tasks.                                   |
| **Temperature** | Controls randomness. Low values yield predictable answers; high values yield more creative ones. |
| **Top K**    | Randomly selects from the top K most likely next words.                                        |
| **Top P**    | Randomly selects from the smallest set of words whose cumulative probability exceeds P.         |

### How These Parameters Work

- **Temperature:**  
  - Low (e.g., 0): More typical, focused answers (good for Q&A, summarization).
  - High (e.g., 1): More creative, diverse outputs (good for creative writing).
- **Top K:**  
  - Limits choices to the K most likely words, then randomly samples among them.
- **Top P (nucleus sampling):**  
  - Dynamically selects a set of words whose cumulative probability meets or exceeds P, then samples from this set.

## Summary Table

| Prompting Method   | Description                                 | Example Use Case           |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Zero-shot          | No examples; just the task                  | Simple Q&A                 |
| One-shot           | One example provided                        | Poem generation            |
| Few-shot           | Multiple examples for guidance              | IT help desk Q&A           |

| Parameter      | Effect on Output                               | When to Use                |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Temperature    | Controls creativity/randomness                 | Creative vs. factual tasks |
| Top K          | Limits to top K likely words                   | Adds controlled diversity  |
| Top P          | Dynamic shortlist based on probability         | Balances creativity/focus  |
