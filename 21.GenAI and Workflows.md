# Introduction to Generative AI and Google Cloud Workflow

---

## What is Generative AI?

- **Generative AI (gen AI)** is a type of artificial intelligence that creates new content, such as text, code, images, speech, video, and even 3D assets.
- It transforms how we interact with technology by automating creative and analytical tasks.

---

## Real-World Applications

- **Marketing Manager:** Automate content creation and distribution across multiple channels.
- **Data Scientist:** Generate SQL queries or analyze data from various sources.
- **App Developer:** Build chatbots for specialized domains like healthcare.

Generative AI can assist in all these scenarios, making it a valuable tool across many professions.

## How Does Generative AI Work?

- **Content Generation:** Produces multi-modal outputs (text, code, images, etc.) in response to prompts.
- **Training:** Learns from large datasets (text, images, video) through a process called training.
- **Foundation Models:** The result of training is a large, versatile model (foundation model) with many parameters, trained on massive datasets and requiring significant computational power.

## Google’s Innovations in Foundation Models

- **Transformer (2017):** The architecture behind most modern gen AI models.
- **Gemini (2023):** A multimodal model capable of handling various data types, pushing towards artificial general intelligence (AGI).
- **Other Models:**
  - **Gemma:** Lightweight, open model for language generation.
  - **Codey:** Specialized for code generation.
  - **Imagen:** Designed for image processing.

*Note: The list of foundation models evolves as technology advances. Gemini may eventually unify multiple modalities, replacing some specialized models.*

## Using Foundation Models

- **Direct Use:** Generate content or solve general problems (e.g., content extraction, summarization).
- **Fine-Tuning:** Further train a foundation model with domain-specific data to solve specialized problems (e.g., finance, healthcare).

### Pre-training vs. Fine-tuning Analogy

- **Pre-training:** Like teaching a dog basic commands—useful for general tasks.
- **Fine-tuning:** Like training a dog for specialized roles (guide dog, police dog)—customized for specific needs.

---

## Large Language Models (LLMs) and Industry Applications

- **General Purpose:** Solve tasks like text classification, question answering, summarization, and generation.
- **Industry-Specific:** Fine-tuned with smaller datasets to address needs in retail, finance, entertainment, and more.

## Business Value of Generative AI

- Enhances productivity
- Reduces operational costs
- Creates new value opportunities

**Example:**  
In the "Coffee on Wheels" use case, gen AI automates marketing, generates customer feedback, and optimizes logistics.

## Accessing Generative AI on Google Cloud

- **Vertex AI:** Google Cloud’s end-to-end platform for both predictive and generative AI.
- **Vertex AI Studio:** Tool for experimenting with and tuning gen AI models.
- **Model Garden:** Repository of various gen AI models for different use cases.

## Generative AI Workflow on Google Cloud

1. **Input Prompt:**  
   Enter a natural language prompt in Vertex AI Studio.
2. **Responsible AI & Safety:**  
   The prompt is checked for safety and compliance (configurable).
3. **Foundation Model Selection:**  
   The prompt is processed by a foundation model (e.g., Gemini, Imagen, Codey).
4. **Model Customization (Optional):**  
   Further tune the model with your own data for specialized tasks.
5. **Results Grounding:**  
   The output may undergo grounding and citation checks to ensure accuracy and reduce hallucinations.
6. **Final Response:**  
   The checked and validated response is displayed in Vertex AI Studio.
