## MLOps and Workflow Automation: Beginner-Friendly Summary and Detailed Explanation

### What is MLOps?

**MLOps** stands for Machine Learning Operations. It combines machine learning (ML) with operations (like DevOps) to help you build, deploy, and manage ML models in a reliable and automated way.  
Think of it as setting up a kitchen where not only do you cook great meals (models), but you also have systems to keep the kitchen running smoothly every day.

### Approaches to Building ML Workflows

You have two main ways to build an end-to-end ML workflow:

1. **Codeless (No-Code) Approach**
   - Use the Google Cloud Console (like AutoML on Vertex AI).
   - Good for beginners or quick experiments.
   - You click through menus to prepare data, train models, and deploy them.

2. **Automated (Code) Approach**
   - Write code to create a pipeline that automates the ML workflow.
   - Enables continuous integration, training, and delivery (CI/CD).
   - Great for teams or when you want to automate and scale your ML processes.

---

### Why is MLOps Important?

- **Production Challenges:**  
  ML models and data change over time. MLOps helps manage these changes and keeps everything running smoothly in production.
- **Automation:**  
  Automates and monitors every step, so you don’t have to do everything manually.
- **Continuous Improvement:**  
  Supports continuous integration (adding new code), continuous training (updating models), and continuous delivery (deploying new models).

### Vertex AI Pipelines: The Backbone of MLOps

- **Vertex AI Pipelines** is a toolkit for automating ML workflows on Google Cloud.
- Supports both **Kubeflow Pipelines (KFP)** and **TensorFlow Extended (TFX)**.
  - Use **TFX** if you already use TensorFlow for large structured data.
  - Use **KFP** for other cases or more flexibility.

### ML Pipeline Components

An **ML pipeline** is a series of steps (components) that automate the ML workflow:

- **Development Environment:**  
  - Data preparation (extract, analyze, clean)
  - Model development (train, evaluate, validate)
  - Result: A trained model, ready for use

- **Production Environment:**  
  - Model serving (make predictions)
  - Model monitoring (check performance)

**Components** are like functions or building blocks.  
- You can use pre-built components from Google or create your own (custom components).
- Each component should do one thing (single responsibility), making them easy to reuse.

### Example: Building an Automated ML Pipeline

Suppose you want to build a pipeline to train, evaluate, and deploy an AutoML model that classifies beans into 1 of 7 types.

**Steps:**
1. **Plan the Pipeline:**  
   - List out each step as a component (e.g., data preparation, training, evaluation, deployment).

2. **Build Custom Components (if needed):**  
   - For example, create a component to check if the model’s evaluation metric meets a threshold before deploying.

3. **Assemble the Pipeline:**  
   - Combine pre-built and custom components.
   - Example components:
     - `TabularDatasetCreateOp`: Creates a dataset.
     - `AutoMLTabularTrainingJobRunOp`: Trains the model.
     - `EndpointCreateOp`: Sets up an endpoint.
     - `ModelDeployOp`: Deploys the model.
     - Custom evaluation component: Checks if the model should be deployed or retrained.

4. **Compile and Run the Pipeline:**  
   - Use the compiler to compile the pipeline.
   - Define and run the pipeline job.

5. **Use Templates:**  
   - Vertex AI provides templates (e.g., for tabular data classification) to help you get started faster.

**Result:**  
You have an automated pipeline that trains, evaluates, and deploys your ML model. It can even decide to retrain the model automatically if performance drops.

### Phases of ML Automation

- **Phase Zero:**  
  - Manual workflow using the UI (like AutoML).
  - Good for learning and initial setup.

- **Phase One:**  
  - Start automating by building components with Vertex AI Pipelines SDKs.
  - Develop reusable building blocks.

- **Phase Two:**  
  - Integrate components into a full pipeline for CI (integration), CT (training), and CD (delivery).

---

### Visualization and Monitoring

- Google Cloud visualizes your pipeline, so you can see each component and its outputs.
- Monitoring is built-in, so you can track performance and automate retraining or deployment as needed.

---

### Key Points for Beginners

- MLOps helps automate and manage the entire ML workflow.
- You can start with manual (no-code) workflows and move to automated pipelines as you grow.
- Pipelines are made of reusable components—some pre-built, some custom.
- Automation enables continuous improvement and reliable production ML systems.
- Tools like Vertex AI Pipelines make building, running, and monitoring ML workflows much easier.
