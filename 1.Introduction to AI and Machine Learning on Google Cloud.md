    AI and ML is being rapidly evolving, especially in field of Generative AI.
    In past 2 years we have seen huge wave of GenAI, and products like ChatGPT(OpenAI), Gemini, Deepseek etc.
    These GenAI models are capable of generating a new content based on Human inputs. 
    With just a prompt to these AI models, one can generate an entire new data (text, images or videos,audios).

### Who can learn AI ?
    Software Developer : If you are a developer, you might need to incorporate AI capabilities in your product
                         for increasing productivity
    Data Scientist : If you are an data scientist you need to train an ML model with your own data to solve the complex business problems.
    ML Developer : If you are a ML Developer, you might need to deploy ML pipline to production.
    
    Even if you are not an AI engineer, you might be curious about cutting-edge advancement, such as generative AI and how they can spark business ideas.

###  What is this course about?
