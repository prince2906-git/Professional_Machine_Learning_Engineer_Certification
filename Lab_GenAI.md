## Lab Activities & Concepts

| Activity/Feature              | What You Do                                 | Key Concepts Practiced                 | Example Use/Outcome                      |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Analyze Images with Gemini**| Upload or input images for analysis         | Multimodal AI, image understanding     | Identify objects, describe scenes, extract information from images |
| **Explore Multimodal Capabilities** | Combine text and images in prompts      | Multimodal input/output, context fusion| Ask questions about images, generate captions, combine visual and textual reasoning |
| **Design Prompts (Free-form)**| Write natural language instructions         | Zero-shot/one-shot prompting, creativity| "Describe this image in detail."         |
| **Design Prompts (Structured)**| Use context, examples, and Q&A pairs       | Few-shot prompting, context setting    | Provide sample Q&A for image analysis    |
| **Generate Conversations**    | Interact with the model in chat mode        | Conversational AI, dialogue generation | Simulate customer support or creative dialogue |
| **Experiment & Iterate**      | Adjust prompts, try different images/tasks  | Prompt engineering, model tuning       | Compare outputs, refine instructions     |

## Tips for Exploration

- **Try different image types:** Objects, scenes, documents, etc.
- **Vary prompt styles:** Direct questions, creative tasks, structured Q&A.
- **Combine modalities:** Ask the model to relate text to image content.
- **Iterate:** Refine your prompts based on the model’s responses.
