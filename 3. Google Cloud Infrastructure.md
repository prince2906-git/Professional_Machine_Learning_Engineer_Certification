Google is working since 1998 on Data and Artificial Intelligence.
In 2008, Google Cloud was launched to provide secure and flexible cloud computing and storage services.

Google Cloud infrastructure can be thought of 3 layers:

    Base Layer >> Networking & Security
    It's a foundation to support of Google Infrastructure and Applications
    
    Middle Layer >> Compute | Storage
        Both compute and storage are decoupled, so that they can be sacled seperately as per need.

    Top Layer >> Data & AI Products
        The top layer includes data and AI/machine learning products, which enable you to perform tasks to ingest, store, process, 
        and deliver business insights, data pipelines, and ML models.

### Compute Engine

    Compute Engine is an Iaas, or infrastructure as a service offering, which provides compute, storage, 
    and network resources virtually that are similar to a physical machine.

    We use the virtual compute and storage resources the same as we manage them locally.

    Compute Engine provides maximum flexibility for those who prefer to manage server instances themselves.

### Google Kubernetes Engine, or GKE

    GKE runs containerized applications in a cloud environment, as opposed to on an individual virtual machine like Compute Engine.
    A container represents code packaged up with all its dependencies.

### Google is App Engine

    A fully managed PaaS, or platform as a service, offering.
    PaaS offerings bind code to libraries that provide access to the infrastructure application needs.
    This allows more resources to be focused on application logic.

### Cloud Run

    A fully managed compute platform that enables you to run requests or event-driven stateless workloads without having to worry about servers.
    It abstracts away all infrastructure management so you can focus on writing code, 
    and it automatically scales up and down from zero, so you never have to worry about scale configuration.
    Cloud Run charges you only for the resources you use, so you never pay for over-provisioned resources.

### Cloud Run Functions

    Cloud Run functions, which executes code in response to events, like when a new file is uploaded to Cloud Storage.
    It’s a completely serverless execution environment, which means you don’t need to install any software locally to run the code and you are free from provisioning and managing servers.
    Cloud Run functions is often referred to as Functions as a Service.

### Where does the processing power come from?

    It’s from the hardware: from computer chips.
    However, traditional computer chips, like a CPU, or central processing unit, and even the more recent
    GPU, or graphics processing unit, may no longer scale to adequately reach the rapid demand for ML.
    To help overcome this challenge, in 2016, Google introduced the Tensor Processing Unit, or TPU.

### Tensor Processing Units

    TPUs are Google’s custom-developed application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) used to accelerate machine learning workloads.
    TPUs act as domain-specific hardware, as opposed to general-purpose hardware like CPUs and GPUs.
    This allows for higher efficiency by tailoring the architecture to meet the computation needs in a domain, such as the matrix multiplication in machine learning.
    TPUs are generally faster than current GPUs and CPUs for AI and ML applications.They are also significantly more energy-efficient.
    Cloud TPUs have been integrated across Google products, making this state-of-the-art hardware and supercomputing technology available to Google Cloud customers.

### Storage

    For proper scaling capabilities, compute and storage are decoupled.
    That is one major difference between cloud and desktop computing.Cloud computing, compute and storage can scale separately.
    Google Cloud offers fully managed database and storage services.

    These include: Cloud Storage, Cloud Bigtable, Cloud SQL, Cloud Spanner, Firestore And BigQuery.

### How do you choose from these products and services?

    It depends on the data type and business needs.

    Unstructured data is information stored in a non-tabular form such as documents, images, and audio files.
    Unstructured data is usually suited to Cloud Storage.
     GCS
        Cloud Storage has four primary storage classes :
           >> Standard storage is considered best for frequently accessed, or “hot,” data.
              It’s also great for data that is stored for only brief periods of time.

           >> Nearline storage best for storing infrequently accessed data, like reading or modifying data once per month 
              or less, on average.
              Examples include data backups, long-tail multimedia content, or data archiving.
            
           >> Coldline storage a low-cost option for storing infrequently accessed data.
              However, as compared to nearline storage, coldline storage is meant for reading or modifying data at most once every 90 days.
  
           >> Archive storage lowest-cost option, used ideally for data archiving, online backup, and disaster recovery.
              It’s the best choice for data that you plan to access less than once a year, because it has higher costs for data access and 
              operations and a 365-day minimum storage duration.

    Structured data, which represents information stored in tables, rows, and columns.
    Structured data comes in two types: transactional workloads and analytical workloads.
    Transactional workloads stem from online transaction processing systems, which are used when fast data inserts and updates are required to build row-based records.
    Analytical workloads, which stem from online analytical processing systems, which are used when entire datasets need to be read.
    They often require complex queries, for example, aggregations.

    Once determined if the workloads are transactional or analytical, then need to identify whether the data will be accessed using SQL or not.

      If data is transactional and you need to access it using SQL, then two options are Cloud SQL and Spanner.
        Cloud SQL works best for local to regional scalability, while Spanner works best to scale a database globally.
  
      If the transactional data will be accessed without SQL, Firestore might be the best option.
         Firestore is a transactional, NoSQL, document-oriented database.

      If you have analytical workloads that require SQL commands, BigQuery is likely the best option.
         BigQuery, Google’s data warehouse solution, lets you analyze petabyte-scale datasets.

      If you have analytical workloads not require SQL commands, Bigtable is likely the best option.
         Bigtable provides a scalable NoSQL solution for analytical workloads.
         It’s best for real-time, high-throughput applications that require only millisecond latency.
