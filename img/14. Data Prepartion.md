## Data Preparation: Beginner-Friendly Summary and Detailed Explanation

### What is Data Preparation in Machine Learning?

Data preparation is the first stage of the machine learning (ML) workflow. Think of it as getting your ingredients ready before you start cooking a meal. In ML, this means uploading your data and making sure it’s clean, organized, and ready for the model to learn from.

### Step 1: Uploading Data

**Where can your data come from?**
- **Cloud Storage:** Like Google Drive, but for big data files.
- **BigQuery:** A Google tool for storing and analyzing large datasets.
- **Local Machine:** Your own computer.

**What types of data does AutoML support?**
- **Image:** Photos or pictures.
- **Tabular:** Data in tables, like spreadsheets.
- **Text:** Sentences, reviews, or documents.
- **Video:** Moving images, like YouTube clips.

### Step 2: Understanding Data Types and Objectives

Each data type can be used to solve different kinds of problems, called **objectives**.

#### Image Data
- **Single-label classification:** Each image gets one tag.  
  *Example: A photo is labeled as either “cat” or “dog”.*
- **Multi-label classification:** Each image can have several tags.  
  *Example: A photo is labeled as “dog”, “large”, and “brown”.*
- **Object detection:** Finding and marking objects in an image.  
  *Example: Drawing boxes around cars in a street photo.*
- **Image segmentation:** Dividing an image into regions.  
  *Example: Separating the sky from the ground in a landscape photo.*

#### Tabular Data
- **Regression:** Predicting a number.  
  *Example: Predicting house prices based on features like size and location.*
- **Classification:** Predicting a category.  
  *Example: Predicting if an email is spam or not.*
- **Forecasting:** Predicting future values over time.  
  *Example: Predicting next month’s sales.*

#### Text Data
- **Text classification:** Sorting text into categories.  
  *Example: Sorting customer reviews as positive or negative.*
- **Entity extraction:** Finding important words or phrases.  
  *Example: Finding names or dates in a document.*
- **Sentiment analysis:** Detecting the mood or feeling in text.  
  *Example: Figuring out if a tweet is happy or angry.*

#### Video Data
- **Action recognition:** Identifying actions in a video.  
  *Example: Detecting if someone is running or jumping.*
- **Video classification:** Labeling the whole video.  
  *Example: Labeling a video as “sports” or “news”.*
- **Object tracking:** Following objects as they move.  
  *Example: Tracking a soccer ball during a match.*

### Step 3: Feature Engineering

**What is feature engineering?**
- It’s like prepping your ingredients before cooking.
- You clean, cut, and prepare the data so the ML model can use it.
- A **feature** is a piece of information that helps the model make predictions.  
  *Example: In a table of houses, “number of bedrooms” is a feature.*

**Why is it important?**
- Good features help the model learn better.
- Sometimes, you need to create new features from existing data.  
  *Example: Turning a full date (“2024-06-01”) into “month” and “day of week” columns.*

### Step 4: Using Vertex AI Feature Store

**What is Vertex AI Feature Store?**
- A central place to store, manage, and share features.
- Makes it easy to use the same features for both training and using (serving) your model.
- Helps keep features consistent and reusable across projects.

**Benefits:**
- **Shareable:** Everyone in your team can use the same features.
- **Reusable:** Save time by not creating the same features over and over.
- **Scalable:** Handles lots of data quickly.
- **Easy to use:** Simple interface for managing features.

**How does it work?**
1. Prepare your data in BigQuery (or another source).
2. Register your features in the Feature Store.
3. Set up resources to connect your data for real-time (online) or batch (offline) use.
4. Serve the latest feature values to your ML models.

**Example:**  
If you have a feature called “customer_age” used in many models, you only need to create it once in the Feature Store. Any model can use it, and it’s always up to date.

### Analogy: Cooking a Meal

- **Uploading Data:** Getting your carrots, onions, and tomatoes from the store.
- **Feature Engineering:** Peeling, chopping, and rinsing your ingredients.
- **Feature Store:** A fridge where you keep all your prepped ingredients, ready to use for any recipe.

### Key Points for Beginners

- Data preparation is about getting your data ready for ML.
- You can use different data types (image, text, tabular, video).
- Each data type can solve different problems (objectives).
- Feature engineering is like prepping ingredients—making data useful for the model.
- Vertex AI Feature Store helps you organize and reuse your features easily.
