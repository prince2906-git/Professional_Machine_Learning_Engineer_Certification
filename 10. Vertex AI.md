Vertex AI, which is the unified platform that supports various technologies and tools on Google Cloud to help you build
an ML project from end to end.
As an AI-first company, Google has applied AI technologies to many of its products and services, like Gmail, Google
Maps, Google Photos, and Google Translate.

But developing these technologies doesn’t come without challenges.
Some traditional challenges include handling large quantities of data, determining the right machine learning model to
train the data, and harnessing the required amount of computing power.
Then, there are challenges around getting ML models into production.Some of the challenges can be scalability,
monitoring, and continuous integration, delivery, and training.

Google’s solution to many of the production and ease-of-use challenges is Vertex AI, a unified platform that brings all
the components of the machine learning ecosystem and workflow together.

### What exactly does a unified platform mean?

    There are two primary aspects: 
        Firstly, it means that Vertex AI provides an end-to-end ML pipeline to prepare data, and create, deploy, and manage models over time, and at scale.
        Secondly, Vertex AI is a unified platform that encompasses both predictive AI and generative AI.
    
    When the data is ready, users can experiment with different models and adjust hyperparameters.
    During deployment and model monitoring, users can set up the pipeline to transform the model into production by automatically monitoring and performing continuous improvements.

Predictive AI allows for sales forecasting and classification
Generative AI enables the creation of multimodal content.

Vertex AI allows users to build ML models with either AutoML, a no-code solution, or custom training, a code-based
solution.
