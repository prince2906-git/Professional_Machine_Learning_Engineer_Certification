# Exploring Gemini Multimodal with Vertex AI Studio

---

## Introduction to Gemini Multimodal

- **Gemini Multimodal** is one of Google’s latest foundation models, designed to process and generate content across multiple modalities (text, images, video, etc.).
- You can access and tune Gemini using **Vertex AI Studio**, which provides a low-code or no-code interface for rapid prototyping, customization, and deployment.

## Capabilities of Gemini Multimodal

- **Multimodal Processing:** Handles inputs and outputs in various formats, such as text, images, and video.
- **Business Use Cases:**
  - **Description and Captioning:** Identify and describe objects in images/videos.
  - **Information Extraction:** Read and extract text from images/videos.
  - **Information Analysis:** Analyze extracted data (e.g., classify expenses from a receipt).
  - **Information Seeking:** Answer questions based on multimodal data.
  - **Content Creation:** Generate stories or ads using images/videos as inspiration.
  - **Data Conversion:** Convert responses to formats like HTML or JSON.

## Real-World Example

- **Upload a photo of a plate of cookies** and ask Gemini for a recipe—Gemini can analyze the image and generate a relevant response.

## Accessing Gemini Multimodal

There are three main ways to interact with Gemini:

1. **No-Code UI:**  
   Use the Google Cloud console’s Vertex AI Studio for exploring and testing prompts.
2. **SDKs and Notebooks:**  
   Use Python, Java, and other language SDKs in environments like Colab or Workbench.
3. **APIs and CLI:**  
   Call Gemini APIs directly using command-line tools like Curl.

*All methods start with a prompt—a natural language request to the model.*

## Understanding Prompts

- **Prompt:** A natural language input (question, instruction, or task) submitted to the model to receive a response.
- **Prompt Components:**
  - **Input (required):** The main request (question, task, entity, or completion).
  - **Context (optional):** Guides the model’s behavior or provides reference information.
  - **Examples (optional):** Input-output pairs that demonstrate the desired response format (few-shot prompting).

### Example: IT Help Desk Prompt

- **Context:** Assume the role of an IT help desk.
- **Examples:**  
  - "Couldn't log in" → Suggest a password reset.  
  - "Lost internet connection" → Suggest checking the modem/router.  
  - "Screen went black" → Suggest restarting the computer.

*When asked, "What should I do when my computer freezes?", the model suggests restarting the computer.*

## Prompt Design

- The process of crafting prompts to get the desired response is called **prompt design**.
- Effective prompt design often involves experimentation with input, context, and examples.

## Using Gemini Multimodal in Vertex AI Studio

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Navigate to Vertex AI Studio Overview**
   - Click "Multimodal powered by Gemini: Try it now."
2. **Interface Overview**
   - **Prompt Field:** Enter your prompt.
   - **Response Field:** View model output.
   - **Configuration Panel:** Adjust model and safety settings.
3. **Upload Media**
   - Click "Insert media" and upload an image (e.g., an airport departure board).
4. **Enter a Prompt**
   - Example: "Read the text from the image."
5. **Adjust Configuration**
   - **Model Selection:** Choose from available models (default: Gemini Pro Vision).
   - **Temperature:** Controls randomness (0 = predictable, 1 = creative).
   - **Safety Settings:** Adjust content moderation (e.g., block hate speech).
6. **Submit and Review**
   - Click "Submit" to get a response.
   - Refine your prompt if needed (e.g., "Read the text from the image and put it into two columns: time and destination.").
   - Try analytical prompts (e.g., "Calculate the percentage of flights to different continents and put them into two columns: percentage and continent.").
7. **Productionize Your Workflow**
   - Click the code icon to view auto-generated code for your prompt and settings.
   - Retrieve Curl commands for API calls.
   - Open a notebook with SDK code (e.g., Python) for further development.
