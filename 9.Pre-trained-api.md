### API

    API stands for application programming interface, and they define how software components communicate with each other.
    Imagine APIs are electric sockets.Different regions have different standards, for example, the US has type A and B whereas Europe has type F. As a traveller,
    you only need to know which adapter to use without worrying about what’s behind the wall and how to build the electric network.

    The same principle applies to APIs.As a user, you only need to know which API to fit your code without worrying about the implementation of the APIs.
    Or in other words, how to train and deploy ML models.

    After you plug the API to your code, you can directly use the functions.

### Pre-trained APIs

    Pre-trained APIs are offered as services.
    In many cases, they can act as building blocks to create the application you want without the expense or complexity of creating your own models.

    Pre-trained API Provided by Google
        Speech, 
        Text, and 
        Language APIs

    For example, the Natural Language API derives insights from text using pre-trained large language models.
    It recognizes the entities and sentiment of a sentence.
    Image and video APIs For example, the Vision API recognizes content in static images, and the Video Intelligence API recognizes motion and action in video.


    Document and data APIs For example, the Document API processes documents like text extraction and form parser.
    It can be used in specialized use cases like lending, contracts, procurement, and identity documents.

### Sentiment Analysis

    Sentiment analysis is used to identify the emotions indicated in the text such as positive, negative, and neutral.
    Score ranges between -1.0 (negative) and 1.0 (positive) and magnitude indicates the overall strength of emotion within the given text,  
    between zero and positive infinity.
    The Natural Language API can analyze the sentiment for the entire document and at entity level.

### How can sentiment analysis be used solve your business problems?

    Sentiment analysis can be used to analyze customer feedback, product reviews, and social media posts.
    It can help you understand how customers feel about your products and services.
    You can use sentiment analysis to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.
    For example, if you find that customers are unhappy with a particular product, you can take steps to address their concerns.

In addition to entity and sentiment analysis, the Natural Language API can analyze syntax and extract linguistic
information for further language model training in a specific field.
It can also classify text into categories and identify the language of the text.
The Natural Language API can be used to analyze text in multiple languages, including English, Spanish, French, German,
Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Arabic.

### Gen AI

    In addition to the above APIs, generative AI APIs have rapidly evolved recently.
    These APIs allow you to use different foundation models to generate various types of content.
    Some examples include Gemini multimodal, processing data in multiple modalities like text, image, and video.
    Embeddings for both text and multimodal, converting multimodal data into numerical vectors that can be processed by ML models, especially gen AI foundation models.
    Gemini for text and chat, performing language tasks and conducting natural conversations.
    
    >> Imagen for Image, generating images and captions.
    >> Chirp for speech, building voice-enabled applications.
    >> PaLM for text, generating text and code.
    >> Codey for code, generating, completing, and chatting about code.

As gen AI advances every day, you’ll find new APIs and models emerging in the near future.
