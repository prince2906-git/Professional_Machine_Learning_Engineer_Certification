# Overview
    The process of building a machine learning (ML) model can be compared to preparing and serving food in a restaurant. There are three main stages in the ML workflow, especially when using Google Cloud’s Vertex AI platform:
    Data Preparation
    Model Development
    Model Serving

    Each stage has its own steps and importance. The workflow is not strictly linear; it is iterative, meaning you may revisit earlier steps as you progress.
    
# Data Preparation
    Definition: This is the stage where you collect, clean, and organize the data that will be used to train your ML model.
    Key Steps:  
        Data Uploading: Bringing your data into the system (e.g., uploading CSV files, connecting to databases).
        Feature Engineering: Transforming raw data into features that help the model learn (e.g., converting dates into day-of-week, normalizing numbers).
    Types of Data:
        Structured Data: Easily stored in tables (e.g., spreadsheets with columns for age, salary, etc.).
        Example: A table with customer names, ages, and purchase amounts.

        Unstructured Data: Not easily stored in tables (e.g., images, audio, videos).
        Example: A folder of product photos or audio recordings of customer service calls.

    Analogy: Like preparing raw ingredients before cooking.

# Model Development
    Definition: This stage involves building and training the ML model using the prepared data.
    Key Steps:
        Training: The model learns patterns from the data.
        Evaluation: Testing the model’s performance to see how well it predicts outcomes.
        Iteration: Repeating training and evaluation to improve the model.
    Analogy:
    Like experimenting with different recipes and cooking methods to get the best dish.

# Model Serving
    Definition: Deploying the trained model so it can make predictions on new data in real time or in batches.
    Key Steps:
        Deployment: Making the model available for use (e.g., as an API).
        Monitoring: Checking if the model continues to perform well over time (watching for issues like “data drift,” where new data is different from training data).
    Analogy: Like finalizing the menu and serving dishes to customers.

# Iterative Nature of the Workflow
    Not Linear: You might need to go back and adjust earlier steps. For example, if the model’s accuracy drops, you may need to revisit data preparation or tweak model parameters.
    Automation with MLOps: Many steps can be automated to make the process more efficient.

# Workflow Options in Vertex AI
    AutoML (No-Code):
        Build models using a graphical interface.
        No coding required.
        Suitable for beginners or those without ML expertise.

    Code-Based (Vertex AI Workbench, Colab, Pipelines):
        Write code to customize and automate the workflow.
        Suitable for experienced ML engineers and data scientists.
        Use SDKs and pipelines for advanced automation.
# Example: Restaurant Analogy
    Data Preparation: Chopping vegetables, marinating meat (preparing raw ingredients).
    Model Development: Trying different cooking techniques and recipes (experimenting in the kitchen).
    Model Serving: Plating and serving the meal to customers (delivering the final product).

    | Data Preparation    | Collecting, cleaning, and transforming data          | Uploading sales data, creating new features          |
    | Feature Engineering | Creating new variables from raw data                 | Extracting “month” from a date column                |
    | Structured Data     | Data in tables, easy to analyze                      | Customer database with rows and columns              |
    | Unstructured Data   | Data not in tables, harder to analyze                | Images, videos, audio files                          |
    | Model Training      | Teaching the model using historical data             | Model learns to predict sales from past transactions |
    | Evaluation          | Testing model accuracy on unseen data                | Checking if predictions match actual sales           |
    | Model Serving       | Deploying the model for real-world use               | Model predicts future sales for new data             |
    | Data Drift          | When new data differs from training data             | Customer behavior changes, model accuracy drops      |
    | MLOps               | Automation of ML workflow steps                      | Automatically retraining model when data changes     |

# Summary
    ML workflow consists of data preparation, model development, and model serving.
    The process is iterative, not strictly linear.
    You can use AutoML (no-code) or code-based approaches in Vertex AI.
    The workflow is similar to preparing and serving food in a restaurant.
