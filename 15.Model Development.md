## Model Development: Beginner-Friendly Summary and Detailed Explanation

### What is Model Development in Machine Learning?

Model development is the second stage of the machine learning (ML) workflow. If you think of data preparation as getting your ingredients ready, model development is like cooking and tasting your meal to make sure it’s good.

### Step 1: Model Training

**What is model training?**
Model training is when the ML model learns from your prepared data. It’s like following a recipe and cooking your ingredients.

**How does it work?**
- You tell Vertex AI which dataset to use (the one you prepared earlier).
- You set the **training objective** (the goal you want the model to achieve, such as classifying images or predicting numbers).
- You choose the **training method**:
  - **AutoML:** No coding needed, great for beginners.
  - **Custom training:** For those comfortable writing code.

**Example:**
If you have a table of house prices, you can train a model to predict the price of a house based on its size and location.

### Step 2: Model Evaluation

**What is model evaluation?**
Model evaluation is testing how well your model performs. It’s like tasting your meal to see if it’s delicious or needs more seasoning.

**How does it work?**
- Vertex AI uses different **evaluation metrics** to measure performance.
- For classification tasks (like sorting emails as spam or not-spam), two important metrics are **precision** and **recall**.

#### Confusion Matrix

A **confusion matrix** is a table that shows how well the model’s predictions match the actual results.
For a simple two-class problem (like cat vs. not-cat), the matrix includes:

|                | Predicted: Yes | Predicted: No  |
|----------------|:--------------:|:--------------:|
| Actual: Yes    | True Positive  | False Negative |
| Actual: No     | False Positive | True Negative  |

- **True Positive (TP):** Model predicted “cat” and it is a cat.
- **True Negative (TN):** Model predicted “not cat” and it is not a cat.
- **False Positive (FP):** Model predicted “cat” but it’s not a cat.
- **False Negative (FN):** Model predicted “not cat” but it is a cat.

#### Precision and Recall

- **Precision:** Of all the times the model said “cat,” how many were actually cats?
  *Formula:* Precision = TP / (TP + FP)
- **Recall:** Of all the actual cats, how many did the model find?
  *Formula:* Recall = TP / (TP + FN)

**Fishing Net Example:**
- You use a wide net and catch 80 fish (TP) and 80 rocks (FP) out of 100 fish in the lake.
  - **Recall:** 80/100 = 80%
  - **Precision:** 80/(80+80) = 50%
- You use a small net and catch 20 fish (TP) and 0 rocks (FP).
  - **Recall:** 20/100 = 20%
  - **Precision:** 20/(20+0) = 100%

**Trade-off:**
- High recall means catching most of the fish, but you might get more rocks.
- High precision means only catching fish, but you might miss many.

**Real-world Example:**
- **Spam filter:** If you want to catch all spam (high recall), you might catch some good emails by mistake (lower precision). If you only want to catch definite spam (high precision), you might let some spam through (lower recall).

### Step 3: Feature Importance and Explainable AI

**Feature Importance:**
Shows which features (ingredients) are most important for the model’s predictions.
- Displayed as a bar chart in Vertex AI.
- Helps you understand which data columns matter most.

**Example:**
If “number of bedrooms” has a long bar, it’s very important for predicting house price.

**Explainable AI:**
A set of tools to help you understand and interpret what your model is doing and why it makes certain predictions.

### Key Points for Beginners

- Model development is about training and testing your ML model.
- You choose your data, set your goal, and pick a training method.
- Evaluation uses metrics like precision and recall to measure performance.
- Feature importance helps you see which data matters most.
- Explainable AI helps you understand your model’s decisions.

### Cooking Analogy

- **Model Training:** Cooking your meal with the ingredients you prepared.
- **Model Evaluation:** Tasting the meal to see if it’s good or needs improvement.
