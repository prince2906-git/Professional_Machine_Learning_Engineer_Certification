# Model Garden in Vertex AI: Accessing a Wide Range of Gen AI Models

---

## What is Model Garden?

- **Model Garden** is a model library within Vertex AI that allows you to search, discover, and interact with a broad selection of generative AI models.
- It includes models developed by Google, third-party providers, and open-source communities.

---

## When to Use Model Garden vs. Vertex AI Studio

- **Vertex AI Studio:**  
  Ideal for building, training, and fine-tuning gen AI models in a comprehensive environment, supported by both UI and code.
- **Model Garden:**  
  Best for quickly finding, evaluating, and applying the right model to solve a specific problem.

---

## Features of Model Garden

- **Model Cards:**  
  Each model comes with a card summarizing its overview, use cases, and links to documentation.
- **Seamless Integration:**  
  Directly launch project development in Vertex AI Studio from Model Garden’s interface.
- **Sample Code & Notebooks:**  
  Access ready-to-use code and Colab notebooks to accelerate development.

## Categories of Models in Model Garden

1. **Foundation Models:**  
   - Large, pretrained, multitask models (e.g., Gemini, Embeddings, Imagen, Chirp, Codey).
   - Can be tuned or customized for specific tasks using Vertex AI Studio, APIs, and SDKs.

2. **Task-Specific Solutions:**  
   - Pre-trained models optimized for specific problems (e.g., entity analysis, sentiment analysis, object detection, text translation).

3. **Fine-Tunable/Open-Source Models:**  
   - Mostly open-source models that can be fine-tuned using custom notebooks or pipelines.

## Filtering and Finding Models

- **Modalities:**  
  Filter by language, vision, speech, etc.
- **Tasks:**  
  Filter by generation, classification, detection, etc.
- **Features:**  
  Filter by pipeline, notebook, one-click deployment, and more.

## Model Garden Workflow

- **Use foundation models** directly in Google Cloud console (Vertex AI Studio) or via APIs.
- **Tune models** in Vertex AI Studio.
- **Deploy models** to production endpoints.
- **Customize and use open-source models** with notebooks and pipelines.

## Example Use Case: Computer Vision with Model Garden

1. **Filter for Vision Models:**  
   On the Model Garden page, select "vision" as the modality.
2. **Select Detection Task:**  
   In the Tasks section, choose "Detection."
3. **Explore Results:**  
   Find models like Owl-Vision Transformer (Owl-ViT), an open-source, zero-shot, text-conditioned object detection model.
4. **View Model Card:**  
   Review the model’s details, use cases, and documentation.
5. **Open Notebook:**  
   Launch a Colab notebook to deploy the model to a Vertex AI endpoint.
6. **Test the Model:**  
   Send an image to the endpoint and receive a text caption describing the image.

**Result:**  
The process from discovering a model to deploying and using it is streamlined and user-friendly with Model Garden.
