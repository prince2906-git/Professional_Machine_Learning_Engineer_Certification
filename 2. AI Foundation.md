### Why AI ?
    Let's explore an example to understand how AI can enhance business efficiency and transform operations.
    
    Coffee on Wheels, an international company that sells coffee on trucks in cities like London, New York, San Francisco, and Tokyo, provides a compelling case study.

    Coffee on Wheels is facing three main challenges: 
    >> Location selection route optimization Predicting popular locations for truck placement, and optimizing routes based on weather and traffic conditions.
    >> Sales forecast and real-time monitoring Forecasting sales and monitoring performance in real-time.
    >> Marketing campaign automation Automating marketing campaigns to increase efficiency and effectiveness.

    Inputs
        This involves incorporating various forms of data, such as 
        Text (customer reviews), 
        Images (coffee and dessert pictures), and
        Videos (real-time street view).
    
    Prediction and generation 
        This is powered by data analytics like 
        Customer segment analysis, 
        Predictive AI like sales forecasting, and 
        Generative AI like marketing campaign automation.

    Visual output 
        The insights and reports are then presented visually, 
        Empowering businesses to make real-time data-driven decisions, and 
        Optimize their operations.
