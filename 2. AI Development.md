Google Cloud offers four options for building machine learning models.

    1. Pre-trained APIs
        API stands for application programming interface.
        This option lets you use pre-trained machine learning models, so you don’t need to build your own if you don’t have training data or machine learning expertise in-house.

    2. BigQuery ML
        This option uses SQL queries to create and execute machine learning models in BigQuery.
        If you already have your data in BigQuery and your problems fit the pre-defined ML models offered by BigQuery ML, this could be your choice.

    3. AutoML
        This is a no-code solution that helps you build your own machine learning models on Vertex AI through a point-and-click interface.

    4. Custom Training Models
        This option allows you flexibility and control over the ML pipeline.

### Which one to use for building ML model ?

    BigQuery ML only supports tabular data, whereas the other three support tabular, image, text, and video.

    Pre-trained APIs also process audio.In terms of training data size, pre-trained APIs do not require any training data, Whereas BigQuery ML and custom training require a large amount of data.

    Pre-trained APIs and AutoML are user friendly with low requirements for machine learning and coding expertise, 
    whereas custom training has the highest requirement, and BigQuery ML requires you to understand SQL.

    At the moment, you can’t tune the hyperparameters with pre-trained APIs or AutoML; 
    However, you can experiment with hyperparameters by using BigQuery ML and custom training.

    Pre-trained APIs require no time to train a model because they directly use pre-trained models from Google.
    The time to train a model for the other three options depends on the specific project.
    Normally, custom training takes the longest time, because it builds the ML model from the beginning, unlike AutoML and BigQuery ML.
    
    The best option depends on your business needs and ML expertise.
    Budget is also an important consideration.
    
    Pre-trained APIs address common perceptual tasks such as vision, video, and natural language.They are ready to use without any model development effort.
    
    If your data engineers, scientists, or analysts are familiar with SQL and already have data in BigQuery, BigQuery ML lets you use SQL queries to build predefined ML models.

    If you wish to build custom models with your own training data while you spend minimal time coding, then AutoML on Vertex AI is your choice.

    AutoML allows you focus on business problems instead of the underlying model architecture and provisioning.

    If your ML engineers and data scientists want full control of ML workflow, Vertex AI custom training lets you train and serve custom models with code on Vertex AI Workbench or Google Colab.
