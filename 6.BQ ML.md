BigQuery can perform both data analytics and build pre-defined ML models .

### Steps To Build Model

    1. Import and prepare the data.
    2. Experiment with different ML models and tune the parameters.
    3. To improve model performance,  go back and forth to train the model with new data and features.
    4. Deploy the model to make predictions.

    This is an iterative process that requires a lot of time and resources.

    With BigQuery ML, you can manage tabular data and execute ML models in one place with just a few steps.
    BigQuery ML tunes the parameters for you and helps you manage the ML workflow.

### Phases of ML project and Key SQL commands

    Phase 1 - Extract, transform, and load data into BigQuery if it isn’t there already.
              If you’re already using other Google products, like YouTube for example, look out for easy connectors to get that data into BigQuery before you build your own pipeline.

    Phase 2 - Select and preprocess features. Use SQL to create the training dataset for the model to learn from.
              BigQuery ML does some of the preprocessing for you, like one-hot encoding of your categorical variables.
              One-hot encoding converts your categorical data into numeric data that is required by a training model.

    Phase 3 - Create the model inside BigQuery.
                Syntax - CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL <dataset>.<model_name> <select query>

    Phase 4 - Train ML Model in BigQuery
                Syntax ML.EVALUATE - specify which evaluation metrics the model will access, such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

    Pahse 5 - when you’re happy with your model performance, you can then use it to make predictions.
              Syntax ML.PREDICT command on your newly trained model to return with predictions and the model’s confidence in those predictions.

Model Supports from BigQuery
Logistic regression model to solve the classification problem.
Regression models such as linear regression.
k-means clustering and time series forecasting models.

In addition to providing different types of machine learning models, BigQuery ML supports MLOps, machine learning
operations.
MLOps turns your ML experiment to production and helps deploy, monitor, and manage the ML models.
