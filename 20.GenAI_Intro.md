## What You Will Learn in This Module

### Introduction to Generative AI

- **Definition:**  
  Generative AI (gen AI) refers to artificial intelligence systems that can create new content, such as text, images, audio, or code, rather than simply analyzing or acting on existing data.
- **How It Works:**  
  Gen AI models are trained on large datasets to learn patterns and structures, enabling them to generate original outputs that resemble the training data.

---

### Generative AI Tools and Integration

- Explore tools that assist in AI development and learn how to integrate gen AI capabilities into broader AI solutions.

---

### Creating a Gen AI Project on Google Cloud

- Learn the steps and best practices for starting a generative AI project using Google Cloud services.

---

### Gemini Multimodal and Vertex AI Studio

- **Gemini Multimodal:**  
  One of Google's latest foundation models, capable of understanding and generating multiple types of data (text, images, etc.).
- **Vertex AI Studio:**  
  The primary tool for developers to access, experiment with, and tune gen AI models, including Gemini.

---

### Prompt Design and Model Tuning

- **Prompt Design:**  
  The art and science of crafting effective prompts to guide gen AI models in producing desired outputs.
- **Model Tuning:**  
  Advanced techniques for customizing gen AI models to better suit specific tasks or datasets.

---

### Model Garden

- **Model Garden:**  
  A model library within Google Cloud that provides access to a variety of gen AI models for different use cases.

---

### Gen AI in AI Solutions

- **Contact Center AI (CCAI):**  
  Example of how generative AI is embedded in real-world AI solutions, enhancing customer support and automation.

---
