### AUTO ML

    AutoML, which stands for automated machine learning, aims to automate the process to develop and deploy an ML model.
    Working with with ML models, building them can be extremely time consuming. need to repeatedly add new data and features, try different models, and tune parameters to achieve the best result.

    AutoML is powered by the latest research from Google.
    There are four distinct phases:
        Phase 1 - Data processing.After you upload a dataset, AutoML provides functions to automate part of the data preparation process.
                  For example, it can covert numbers, datetime, text, categories, arrays of categories, and nested fields into a certain format of data so that it can be fed into an ML model.
        Phase 2 - Searching the best models and tuning the parameters.  
                  Two critical technologies support this auto search.
                    >> first is called neural architect search, which helps search the best models and tune the parameters automatically.
                    >> second is called transfer learning, which helps transfer the knowledge from one model to another.
        Phase 3 - Training the model.
                    AutoML will train the model with the best architecture and parameters.
        Phase 4 - Evaluation and prediction.
                    AutoML will evaluate the model and make predictions.

    AutoML has already trained many different models with large amounts of data.These trained models can be used as a foundation model to solve new problems with new data.
