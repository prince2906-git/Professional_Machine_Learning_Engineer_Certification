### AI

    Artificial intelligence, or AI, is an umbrella term that includes anything related to computers mimicking human intelligence.
    E.g. Robots and self-driving cars.

### ML

    Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows computers to learn without being explicitly programmed.
    This is in contrast to traditional programming, where the computer is told explicitly what to do.
    Machine learning mainly includes supervised and unsupervised learning.
    Deep learning, or deep neural networks are subset of machine learning that adds layers in between input data and output results to make a machine learn at much depth.

### Generative AI

    It produces content and performs tasks based on requests.
    Generative AI relies on training extensive models like large language models.
    These models are a type of deep learning model.

### Difference between Supervised and Unsupervised Learning

    Let us consider two problems to understand Supervised and UnSupervised Learning
    
    First Problem : Identify, if the picture is of dog or cat ?
    We already know the difference between Dogs and Cats. So I labled each picture and pass it to machine.
    By learning from the data, in this case pictures with answers or lables, supervised learning is being enacted, 
    allowing the machine to tell if a new picture represents a dog or cat in the future.
    
    Second Problem : Identify the breeds of dogs
    This time I don't know much about the breeds, so I am not able to lable the pictures.
    I send these pictures to machine, without lables. This machine learns from data without answers and finds underlying patterns to group the animals.
    This is an example of unsupervised learning.

    An easy way to distinguish between the two is that supervised learning provides each data point with a label, or an answer, while unsupervised does not.

### Types of Supervised Learning

    Classification : which predicts a categorical variable, such as determining whether a picture shows a cat or a dog.
    Model Used for Classification - Logistic Regression 
    
    Regression : [A way to understand and predict how one thing (a dependent variable) changes when another thing (an independent variable) changes].
         Predicts a numeric variable, like forecasting sales for a product based on its past sales.
    Model Used for Regression - Linear Regression

    Model KNN [Nearest Neighbour Used for both Classification and Regression ] 

### Types of UnSupervised Learning

    Clustering : which groups together data points with similar characteristics and assigns them to "clusters," like using customer demographics to determine customer segmentation.
    Model Used for Clustering - k-means.
    
    Association : which identifies underlying relationships, like a correlation between two products to place them closer together in a grocery store for a promotion.
    Model Used for Association - Apriori

    Dimensionality reduction : which reduces the number of dimensions, or features, in a dataset to improve the efficiency of a model.
    For example, combining customer characteristics like age, driving violation history, or car type, to create a simplified rule for calculating an insurance quote.

    Model Used for Dimensionality Reduction :   Principal component analysis

*** Customer Segmentation - Customer segmentation is the process of dividing a customer base into distinct groups based
on shared characteristics like demographics, behavior, or preferences
